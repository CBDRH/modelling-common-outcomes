## Basic concepts

### Odds ratios versus risk ratios 

The terms odds ratio and risk ratio are often used interchangeably or interpreted in the same way, but they are different quantities. 

#### The Odds
The _odds_ of an outcome in a given group or population is the number of times the outcome occurs divided by the number of times the outcome does not occur. 

#### The Odds Ratio
The _odds ratio_ is the ratio of two odds: the odds of the outcome in the exposed group divided by the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group.

#### The Risk

The _risk_ of a binary outcome in a given group is the same as a _probability_, i.e. the number of times the outcome occurs divided by the total number of individuals in the group.

#### The Risk Ratio
The _risk ratio_ is the ratio of two risks: the risk of the outcome in the exposed group divided by the risk of the outcome in the unexposed group.


### Illustration

We can illustrate these definitions with a simple example. Consider the following table which includes a binary exposure and binary outcome.

![](images/tab1.png){width=300}


#### The Odds Ratio


The odds of the outcome in the exposed group is 
$$
odds_{exposed} = \frac{a}{b}
$$
Similarly, the odds of the outcome in the non-exposed group is 
$$
odds_{non-exposed} = \frac{c}{d}
$$

The _odds ratio_ (OR) is the ratio of these values, i.e. the odds of death in the drug group relative to the placebo group is

$$
OR = \frac{odds_{exposed}}{odds_{non-exposed}} = \frac{ad}{bc}
$$


#### The Risk Ratio

The _risk_ of the outcome for the exposed group is 

$$
risk_{exposed} = \frac{a}{a+b}
$$ 

The risk of the outcome for the non-exposed group is

$$
risk_{non-exposed} = \frac{c}{c+d}
$$

The _risk ratio_ (RR) is the ratio of these two values: 

$$
RR = \frac{risk_{exposed}}{risk_{non-exposed}} = \frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)}
$$


**Note a key difference when calculating the odds and the risk is the denominator used**

### A worked example 
Consider a randomised control trial studying the effect of meditation on students' emotional state. Study participants were randomised to either the treatment group or a control group. The treated group were taught mindfulness techniques and asked to meditate for 20 minutes every day, while a control group made no change to their routine. At the end of the study, participants reported their emotional state. 

The data found that out of 50 students in the treated group, 45 reported being calm, while 5 reported being stressed at the end of the study. Out of 200 patients in the control group, 40 reported being stressed, while 160 reported being calm.

We can arrange these data in a 2 $\times$ 2 table as before.

![](images/tab2.png){width=300}

#### Odds 
Following the previous example, the odds of being calm versus stressed for the meditation group is
$$
odds_{meditation}=\frac{a}{b} = \frac{45}{5} = 9
$$
We can interpret this as saying that for every 9 calm people in the meditation group there was one stressed person.

The odds of being calm versus stressed for the control group is
$$
odds_{control}=\frac{a}{b} = \frac{160}{40} = 4
$$
We can interpret this as saying for every 4 calm people in the control group there was one stressed person.

#### Odds Ratio

The odds ratio is the odds in the meditation group divided by the odds in the control group:

$$
OR = \frac{odds_{meditation}}{odds_{control}} = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25
$$
We can interpret this as saying the odds of feeling calm was 2.25 times higher in the group who practiced meditation compared to the control group.

#### Risk 

The probability or "risk" of being calm in the meditation group is 
$$
risk_{meditation} = \frac{a}{a + b} = \frac{45}{50} = 0.90
$$
The probability or "risk" of being calm in the control group is 
$$
risk_{control} = \frac{c}{c + d} = \frac{160}{200} = 0.80
$$

#### Risk ratio 
The risk ratio is the probability or "risk" of being calm in the meditation group divided by the "risk"" of being calm in the control group:

$$
RR = \frac{risk_{meditation}}{risk_{control}}=\frac{0.90}{0.80} = 1.125
$$
We can interpret this as saying the probability of being calm was 12.5% higher in the group practicing meditation compared to the group that did not.

### Scenario

In a cohort study examining infection after surgery among 125 patients, 25 were treated with a novel antibiotic therapy while the remainder received care as usual. In the treated group, 5 patients developed an infection and in the usual care group 40 patients developed an infection.

### Solution

How did you do? If you got all the questions correct, congratulations, you've clearly grasped the fundamentals!

Let's have a look at the solution. To start, it can be helpful to summarise the available data in a 2 $\times$ 2 table as before:

![](images/tab4.png){width=400}


The first question asks for **the odds of remaining infection-free in the treated group**. Recall that the odds in a group is the number of times the outcome occurs divided by the number of times the outcome does not occur. So for the treated group, we have:

$$
odds_{treated} = 20/5 = 4
$$
Interpretation: In the treated group, for every patient who experienced a post-survey infection, there were four patients who did not experience an infection. 

The second question asks for **the probability of remaining infection-free in the usual-care group**. Recall the probability or "risk" of an outcome in a given group is the number of times the outcome occurs divided by the total number of individuals in the group. So for the usual-care group, we have:

$$
risk_{usual.care} = 60/100 = 0.60
$$
Interpretation: The probability of remaining infection-free in the usual care group was 60%.

The third question asks for **the Odds Ratio of remaining infection-free for the treated group relative to the usual-care group**. We've already calculated the numerator for this quantity above, the odds for the treated group. The odds for the usual care group is:

$$
odds_{usual.care} = 60/40 = 1.5
$$
The odds ratio is therefore:

$$
OR = \frac{odds_{treated}}{odds_{usual.care}} = \frac{4}{1.5} = 2.67
$$
Interpretation: The odds of remaining infection-free was 2.67 times higher in the group receiving the new antibiotic compared to the usual care group.


The fourth question asks for **The Risk Ratio for remaining infection-free for the treated group relative to the usual-care group**. We've calculated the risk in the usual care group for Question 2, so we are halfway there already. The risk in the treated group is:

$$
risk_{treated} = 20/25 = 0.80
$$
Therefore, the risk ratio is given by

$$
RR = \frac{risk_{treated}}{risk_{usual.care}} = \frac{0.80}{0.60} = 1.33
$$
Interpretation: The probability of remaining infection-free was 33% higher in the antibiotic group compared to the usual care group.
